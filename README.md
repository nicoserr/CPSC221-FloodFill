# Flood Fill Algorithm For Images for CPSC 221 2021W *
An algorithm that fills an image with a particular pattern (Rainbow, Grid or Solid) by placing the pixels in either a Stack or a Queue and then determines the colour with which to fill the pixel when it is removed from the ordering structure. This means we either fill the image with a Depth First Search (that utilizes a Stack) or a Breadth First Search (that utilizes a Queue).
